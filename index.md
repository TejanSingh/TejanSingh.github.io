**A team entry to University of Arizona Spring 2020 Game jam**

The game was made over the course of 48 hours to the theme "You are the bad guy". Prisoner #3774 came in 3rd place of about 20 entries.
Old PSX games with fixed camera systems like resident evil were the main influence in the art and style of this game.

**My Contributions:**
- Programmed enemy Line of Sight and AI behavior
- Created and integrated all animation trees
- Programmed Player movement
- Designed post-bridge section of level
