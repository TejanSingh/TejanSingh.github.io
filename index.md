# Projects

## Modular Generator

**Modular Generator capable of seamlessly connecting modules for endless randomly generated content**

The modular generator featured above uses a system of modules with connection points to create content of any size and scale.
The applications of this generator are far reaching: modular items like weapons, modular roads or cities, infitely deep dungeons,
and much more. Defining a module to work within the generator is very simple, this is the reason the generator can be applied to many 
different uses. The Generator was built within Unity and utilizes prefab spawning and full collision detection.


## Game Jams

**A team entry to University of Arizona Spring 2020 Game jam**

The game was made over the course of 48 hours to the theme "You are the bad guy". Prisoner #3774 came in 3rd place of about 20 entries.
Old PSX games with fixed camera systems like resident evil were the main influence in the art and style of this game.

**My Contributions:**
- Programmed enemy Line of Sight and AI behavior
- Created and integrated all animation trees
- Programmed Player movement
- Designed post-bridge section of level
